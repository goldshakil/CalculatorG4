//Assign01_ProgrammingLanguages

1)Make sure to have an input file for evaluation(e.g. Input.txt).

2)Use the command "antlr4 Expr.g4" to generate a parser for my grammar.

3)Make sure the java file "ExprEvalApp.java" is in the same directory as "Expr.g4".
*this will help in compiling everything together.

4)Compile all java files using "javac Expr*.java"
*this will compile all java files including "ExprEvalApp.java".

5)Run my java file using "java ExprEvalApp input.txt".

6) You will get the output.
